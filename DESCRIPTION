Package: SparseMSE
Title: Multiple systems estimation for Sparse capture data
Version: 1.1.1
Authors: Lax Chan, Bernard W. Silverman, Kyle Vincent
Maintainer: Bernard W. Silverman <mail@bernardsilverman.co.uk>
Description: Implements the routines and algorithms developed and analysed in "Multiple systems estimation for Sparse Capture Data: Inferential Challenges when there are Non-Overlapping Lists" Chan, L, Silverman, B. W., Vincent, K (2019) (arXiv:1902.05156 [stat.ME]). This package explicitly handles situations where there are pairs of lists which have no observed individuals in common.
